# JavaLinearSearchAlgorithm
Java code for performing linear search on arrays
This code implements a simple linear search algorithm to find an item (either a string or an integer) in two arrays. Here's a brief overview:

    -Two methods strSearch and intSearch are defined to perform linear search on string and integer arrays, respectively.
    -Inside the main method, two arrays are initialized: myClientsArray containing client names and myClientNumbers containing client numbers.
    -The user is prompted to enter a client name or number.
    -The input is passed to the respective search method, and the result (whether the item is found or not) is printed.
